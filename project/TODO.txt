# - input section content
	# - input line for stream 1
		# - have a button on the left to toggle platform
		# - yt "Youtube shortcode"
		# - ttv "Twitch streamer / video ID"
	# - input line for stream 2
		# - -||-

# - TimeInput
	# - pad 0 on lost focus
	# - set all lineedit min character width to eg. 2 then manually resize it to fit better than it does using min character width 3
	# - add description to all lineedits
	# - add limit character stuff to all line edits
	# - possible split the scrit stuff into three (TimeInputs children) (nope)
	# - disable the options that arent relevant
	# - clear all fields on load, prolly do func call from TimeInput.gd to the relevant node
	# - force limit value on lost focus, not while typing

# - gotta redo the single timestamp sticks to show time for both streams at timestamp

# - remember to hook up the refresh token button
# 	- and the time remaining label (make red if 00:00:00)

# - remember to limit the amount of days in a month in TimeInput
# 	make the "max value" key a callable? design in python prolly
# 	- feb 29 if year % 4 == 0

# - have a reset button for section resizers
# 	- or just left click to reset?
# 	- or left click on the buttons to open a popup menu with option "Reset", would have 3 of those for each resize button
# 	- the Reset button does different things depending on which resizer it stems from
# 		- Vertical: Reset vertical
# 		- Horizontal: Reset horizontal
# 		- Multidimentional: Reset vertical and horizontal

# - make the 3stepcheckbutton hitbox bigger by adding 3 invis buttons behind it but in front of the labels to increase hitbox size

# - have the submit button be disabled until all required values have been submitted
	# - if relative_to_utc and Date + time is selected: make sure the day is valid
		# func = lambda m, y : 30 + ((m + (1 if m > 7 else 0)) % 2) + (-1 if m == 2 and not y % 4 else -2 if m == 2 else 0)
	# - have a label next to the button with why its disabled (nope)
		# "All required fields have not been filled"
		# "The day {d} is invalid with month = {m} and year = {y}"
		# "Certain api credentials are missing"
		# "The twitch api access token is expired"

# - add background to InnerTimestampStick labels to help it from OuterTimestampStick vertical sticks
	# - is there a way to get if nodes are overlapping? only add background then?
	# - use partially transparent bg that can be seen on top of orange, but not normal bg?

# - on run exe: clear everything thats not default from data and overlap sections

# - pressing tab while inserting time value stops the padding from activating

# - something is scuffed with relative time values for outer timestamp sticks

# - have a little icon to show if its a twitch or yt stream

# - make some solution to one streambox being very tiny compared to the other, thus making the labels go past the right edge

# - have some banner decend from above displaying error messages
	# config submit button for this
	# display the error messages from exe here
	# go through all "print..." commands and have them throw errors

# - apiinput nodes are scuffed when resized, prolly gotta do custom anchoring to fix

# - set up tab support for stream and time inp
# 	(its built into godot i think)

# - scuff in default time inp when writing "123" in hours

# - add loading symbols when saving creds, refreshing token and fetching stream data
# 	maybe dedicate a section of the data section

# - add a check when calculating the size of the streamboxes (nope, let the user feel stupid by the messed up graphics)
# 	if the boxes would be smaller than their minimum size then throw error that says something like "Streams are too far apart"
# 	make sure to tell the user when each stream starts

# - inner stick vert alignment scuffed

# - make gray dot same as clear color?

# - what happens if i do timestamp at 24h (should change value_delta depending on this

# - press enter to submit? maybe only if on the last timeinput text field?

# - update the tooltip "Relative to: {_}".format(UTC/Stream 1/Stream 2)

# - when switching the relative to stream only reset the value if input type Time goes to Date


# - Have click on time stamp stick open its data in data section and not switch between date and relative.
  # - Default thing in data section is showing the streams (with title + author?) + the regular url. 
  # - There’s also a label where the timestamp stick data would go that says “click on a timestamp stick to show more information”. 
  # - Have the timestamp stick tooltip be “show more”? 
  # - Potentially split the data section into 2 sections. 
	  # - 1 for stream info and one for timestamp info + “open stream at timestamp”
